# Somalia Climate Conflict Displacement Index

Welcome to the **Somalia Climate-Conflict-Displacement Index** repository. This repository contains all the data, analyses, and resources from my MSc thesis, focused on integrating climate, conflict, and displacement data to guide humanitarian decision-making in Somalia.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create an index that assesses vulnerabilities and supports anticipatory actions by combining diverse datasets on climate variability, conflict intensity, and displacement patterns in Somalia. This research is particularly crucial in the humanitarian context, where communities face increasing risks from climate change and protracted conflicts, leading to significant displacement and humanitarian crises. By integrating these datasets, the index aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions about interventions and resource allocations in areas most affected by climate and conflict-induced displacement. Ultimately, this work seeks to enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations and facilitate timely and effective humanitarian responses.
